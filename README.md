  ## Description 
  
  This repository holds the code for a simple social network API. Because the focus of this repo is to demonstrate knowledge and a grasp of the back-end of a possible web application, there is no front-end or deployed app. The interested party would need to incorporate a REST API client such as Insomnia or Postman to test the API routes and simulate client-side server requests. In brief, Node.js is paired with the server framework Express.js to establish API routes and the corresponding HTTP request methods; a NoSQL, MongoDB database is paired with the object-document mapper (ODM) Mongoose for holding the data and defining the schema/models, respectively. A user can create a thought, a reaction to another user's thought, add and remove friends; routes have also been built for getting all users and thoughts, and deleting users and thoughts.
